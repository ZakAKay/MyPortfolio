      <h3>Football</h3>
      <a href="./football.jpg"></a>
      <p>
        Ive always enjoyed watching football due to its team first oriantation
        coupled with all the different strategies that can be used to defeat the
        opposing teams. Plus its really fun talking smack to another teams
        fanbase
      </p>
      <h3>Flyfishing</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing in this world sooths my soul quite like flyfishing. To quote the
        great Ron Swanson, "fishing is like yogo, except I still get to kill
        something".
      </p>
      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <p>
        Im a huge science fiction fan, and nothing scratches that itch quite
        like reading. Movies and TV shows are nice, but its nothing compared to
        what i imagin when reading a good book.
